# Culver City High School FRC Robotics Club
Hello! This is the account that should be used by any robotics member who would like to push/pull code from our [Official GitHub Organization](https://github.com/702bagelbytes).

Please do **not** use your personal GitHub account to commit changes unless you seriously know what you're doing. Trying to set up and later remove SSH keys is a nightmare for newbies xD

If you have any questions, please contact a Programming Mentor or one of the heads of programming.

### Happy Coding! ðŸ’»
